# Vulkanic
The vulkanic engine

The engine uses several libraries:
* [tinyrenderers](https://github.com/chaoticbob/tinyrenderers)
* [tiny_obj_loader](https://github.com/syoyo/tinyobjloader)
* stb_image from [stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb)

This engine tries to be a simple renderer for vulkan. Currently it only supports windows since I can't get my AMD R9 270X to work with vulkan under manjaro/arch linux. If anyone has a tip, you're welcome!

To build, simply use cmake and set the apropriate variables.   
In example.h and example.cpp you can see a usage example.

If you want to contribute please look in the issues tab to see what has to be done.

Currently the assets are missing the .obj files, i'm sure you can find the teapot online.
