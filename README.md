# Vulkanic
The vulkanic engine

This engine tries to be a simple renderer for vulkan. Currently it only supports windows since I can't get my AMD R9 270X to work with vulkan under manjaro/arch linux. If anyone has a tip, you're welcome!

To build, simply use cmake and set the apropriate variables.   
In example.h and example.cpp you can see a usage example.

If you want to contribute please look in the issues tab to see what has to be done.
